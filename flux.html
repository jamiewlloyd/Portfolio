            <span class="bold">Project Type:</span> Branding | Logo<br><br>
            <span class="bold">Brief:</span> Video Flux is a new short-format video sharing app that aims to be popular and shareable, while also being a voice and platform for the younger generations.
            The target audience for the app is people aged 16 to 35, who may also already use apps such as TikTok and Snapchat. The branding for Video Flux needed to include a logo that is simple and can 
            look good in small spaces. It could include a logo mark but not a mascot or complicated illustration. The branding will also be used to help pitch to investors so the final product needed to be polished and professional.<br><br>
            <span class="bold">Key Words:</span> Trendy | Youthful | Hip | Edgy | High-energy | Dynamic<br><br>
            <span class="bold">Comments:</span> Looking at the current market competitors and keeping the target audience in mind, we decided that 'Flux' would be a better suited
                name than 'Video Flux'. While sketching the original ideas for Flux's branding, the 'trendy' and 'dynamic' keywords became the most prominent from the brief. 
                I wanted to create a logotype that could be recognisable alone but also be seamlessly repeated in a way that emulates a video feed on an app. Gradients are a re-emerging trend
                that I wanted to incorporate, focusing on the 'high-energy' keyword while selecting the colours. The logomark created is very simple as requested but also easily recognisable.
